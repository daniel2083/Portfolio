# Daniel Ansari — Cybersecurity-Focused Developer
**Automation • AI • Secure Web Applications**

I’m a cybersecurity-focused developer with hands-on experience in vulnerability assessments, Python automation, and AI-assisted security tooling. I combine security-first thinking with practical development skills to build and improve systems that are not only functional, but secure by design.

## Highlights
- **IT Security Engineer (Higher Vocational Education, 400 YH credits)** — Nackademin (Sweden) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** (Coursera / Google)
- **Internship (LIA) at SpendNinja** — delivered **two vulnerability assessments** for two different customers
- Built multiple **Python projects** in automation and AI-assisted analysis
- Strong understanding of **web application architecture** (HTTP/HTTPS, sessions, auth flows, APIs) from a security perspective

---

## Focus Areas
- Web application security (OWASP Top 10, auth, sessions, APIs)
- Vulnerability assessments & risk reporting
- Python automation & scripting
- AI-assisted security analysis (local LLM workflows & automation)
- Security-first development practices

---

## Internship Experience — SpendNinja (LIA)
During my internship at **SpendNinja**, I carried out **A number of real-world vulnerability assessments** for different customers.

**Work included:**
- Assessing web applications for security weaknesses (auth, misconfigurations, logic flaws)
- Risk rating and prioritization
- Writing clear reports with mitigation recommendations
- Communicating findings to stakeholders

## Selected Projects (Examples)
### 1) Automated Vulnerability Analysis Tool (Python)
A Python tool designed for **passive security analysis** of web applications.

**Key capabilities:**
- Collects publicly available information without impacting production systems
- Analyzes HTTP headers, cookies, and configuration signals
- Outputs structured reporting for security review

**Tech:** Python, HTTP analysis, automation, reporting

### 2) AI-Assisted Security Automation & Analysis
A set of smaller experiments exploring AI as **decision support** for security tasks.

**Examples:**
- Summarizing and interpreting security signals
- Automating repetitive workflows
- Local LLM-assisted security analysis

### 3) Web Application Security Practice
Hands-on practice focusing on:
- Authentication/session handling
- API communication and trust boundaries
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Secure design principles
